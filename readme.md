# Deployment:

### Github Pages:
Discover Skåne was written in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), and pushed to [Github](https://github.com/) for version control.
The repository was named 'Discover Skane' rather than 'Discover Skåne' as the letter 'å' was not a valid character, and 'Discover Sk-ne' 
was suggested instead.
